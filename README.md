Why you chose each loop type for each challenge
For the first challenge I used a while loop because we had to keep redoing the code untli the number was equal to 1. I used a for loop for the second challenge because it allowed me to continue redoing the code with also iterating through the given range without having to hard code the iteration between each loop. I used a for loop for the last challenge for the same reason as challenge two as I needed the code to specifically keep redoing itself over a specific range.
How your solutions work
My first solution works by taking in the starting number then redoing the loop and performing the calcualtions over and over again until the value is equal to one. My second solution works by taking a number and using a for loop to iterate through every number and see if when divided it doesnt have a remainder and if one of them give a remainder it shows its not prime if none do it shows the number is prime. My last soltution works by taking in a range and printing out the numbers in that range while using end= to format the output.

AI was only used for minor debugging for helping to understand what each challenge needed and what each asked us to do.
